/*Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz"
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed
out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it,
youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
